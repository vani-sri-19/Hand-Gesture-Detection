# Hand-Gesture-Detection
Hand Gesture Detection system that utilizes Media Pipe and TensorFlow APIs 

This project detects and identifies hand gestures such as 'Thumbs Up', 'Hello', 'Fist', and more. Using MediaPipe and TensorFlow libraries, the code processes the video canvas to recognize gestures, displaying the identified gesture at the top of the canvas. The code was developed and tested in the AncientBrain worlds.

# Hand Gesture Detection  

A **hand gesture recognition system** utilizing **MediaPipe** and **TensorFlow** to detect and classify gestures such as:  
- 👍 **Thumbs Up**  
- 👋 **Hello**  
- ✊ **Fist**  
- ...and more!  

## Overview  

This project processes video input to identify hand gestures in real time. Using **MediaPipe** and **TensorFlow** for hand tracking and gesture classification, the system overlays the recognized gesture text at the top of the canvas.  

The code was developed and tested in **AncientBrain Worlds**.  

## Technologies Used  

- **MediaPipe** – Hand tracking and landmark detection  
- **TensorFlow** – Machine learning-based gesture classification  
- **JavaScript** – Implementation and processing
